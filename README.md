# Loan_Prediction
A loan application is used by borrowers to apply for a loan. Through the loan application, borrowers reveal key details about their finances to the lender. The loan application is crucial to determining whether the lender will grant the request for funds or credit.

Problem Statement
The director of SZE bank identified that going through the loan applications to filter the people who can be granted loans or need to be rejected is a tedious and time-consuming process. He wants to automate it and increase his bank’s efficiency.
